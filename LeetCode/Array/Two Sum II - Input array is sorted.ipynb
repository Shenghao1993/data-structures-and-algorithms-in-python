    "We use two indexes, initially pointing to the first and last element respectively. Compare the sum of these two elements with target. If the sum is equal to target, we found the exactly only solution. If it is less than target, we increase the smaller index by one. If it is greater than target, we decrease the larger index by one. Move the indexes and repeat the comparison until the solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let [... , a, b, c, ... , d, e, f, ...] be the input array that is sorted in ascending order and the element b, e be the exactly only solution. Because we are moving the smaller index from left to right, and the larger index from right to left, at some point one of the indexes must reach either one of b or e. Without loss of generality, suppose the smaller index reaches bb first. At this time, the sum of these two elements must be greater than target. Based on our algorithm, we will keep moving the larger index to its left until we reach the solution."
